# CS665-HW4
# Integration of Legacy and New Systems

## Implementation Description

In this project, we have developed a software system that facilitates the integration of a legacy system's interface with a new system's interface. The design of our implementation is guided by key software design principles to ensure flexibility, simplicity, and maintainability.

### Flexibility and Extensibility

Our implementation prioritizes flexibility, making it straightforward to add or remove object types in the future. This flexibility is achieved through the use of the Adapter design pattern. The `CustomerDataAdapter` serves as an intermediary, enabling the new system's interface to seamlessly work with the old system's API. This design allows for the easy integration of new object types by creating additional adapters while keeping existing code unaltered.

### Simplicity and Understandability

We have designed the implementation with simplicity and ease of understanding in mind. The Adapter pattern provides a clear separation of concerns, making it comprehensible for developers. Each class has a well-defined purpose, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

### Avoiding Duplicated Code

Our approach emphasizes the avoidance of duplicated code. The Adapter pattern ensures code reusability by allowing existing methods from the legacy system to be used within the adapter. This practice reduces the potential for errors and simplifies code maintenance. Updates or fixes can be applied in one place, the legacy system, and will automatically propagate to all corresponding adapters.

### Design Patterns

The implementation utilizes the Adapter design pattern to integrate the legacy and new system's interfaces. This pattern facilitates the adaptation of the old system's interface to meet the requirements of the new system, preserving compatibility between the two systems while accommodating future changes.

Our implementation exemplifies the application of these design principles, enabling the easy integration of new object types, ensuring simplicity and maintainability, avoiding code duplication, and utilizing a design pattern to achieve compatibility between systems.

By adhering to these principles, our design ensures effective integration of legacy and new systems that is adaptable for future modifications.
